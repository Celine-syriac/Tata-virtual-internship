####Tata iQ Virtual Experience Program Readme

This virtual experience program, offered by Tata iQ (Tata Insights and Quants), allowed me to explore how passionate, multidisciplinary experts use data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI to address complex business challenges and reveal valuable insights hidden within extensive datasets.

### Program Overview
The program replicates the types of challenges encountered daily by Tata Insights and Quants, providing a realistic experience of the kinds of problems one might face in the field. The program consists of four key modules:

1. **Framing the Business Scenario**: Anticipate the questions business leaders need answered.
2. **Choosing the Right Visuals**: Select the most effective visuals for given scenarios.
3. **Creating Effective Visuals**: Apply your understanding to create visuals based on business needs.
4. **Communicating Insights and Analysis**: Present your findings clearly and effectively.

### Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario
In this task, I acted as a consultant for an online retail store. The CEO and CMO were interested in analyzing the store's performance and identifying key revenue drivers to inform next year's strategic planning. My role involved drafting questions that would be crucial for both the CEO and CMO, taking into account their distinct perspectives on business decisions.

- **Objective**: Create a set of eight questions (four for the CEO and four for the CMO) to guide the analysis and ensure alignment with business goals.

### Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals
For this task, I was tasked with selecting the most suitable visualizations to meet the analytical needs of the CEO and CMO. The goal was to convey insights clearly and accurately, helping senior management understand business performance and identify growth opportunities.

- **Objective**: Answer multiple-choice questions by selecting the best visualizations for specific business scenarios.

### Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals
In this task, I created visualizations using either Tableau or Power BI to address specific questions posed by the CEO and CMO. The visuals were designed to provide insights into trends, revenue breakdowns, and other key factors influencing the online store's performance.

- **Objective**: Clean the provided data, create visuals for each question on separate tabs, and save the files in the appropriate format for presentation.

The four questions addressed in this task were:

1. **The CEO's Request**: The CEO wanted to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011, broken down by month. This analysis aimed to identify seasonal trends and assist in forecasting for the next year.

2. **The CMO's Request**: The CMO was interested in viewing the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue, along with the quantity sold. The United Kingdom was excluded from this analysis.

3. **The CMO's Request**: The CMO wanted to see the revenue data for the top 10 customers, with the highest revenue-generating customer displayed first and the others in descending order. This would help the CMO target key customers and ensure their satisfaction.

4. **The CEO's Request**: The CEO sought insights into the demand for products across different regions, excluding the United Kingdom. This analysis was intended to guide the company's expansion strategy by identifying regions with the highest demand.

### Task 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis
The final task involved presenting my findings to the CEO and CMO. I developed a script and recorded a video explaining my thought process, data cleanup, and the insights derived from the visualizations. The presentation focused on identifying the most lucrative opportunities for business expansion based on the analysis.

- **Objective**: Clearly communicate the analysis and how it relates to the business scenarios, emphasizing the most relevant information for the CEO and CMO.
